\section{Introduction}
In an increasingly digital world, technology plays a pivotal role in daily life, from communication and healthcare to entertainment and financial management. However, a significant portion of the population—older adults—often faces barriers in accessing and utilizing these tools effectively. Aging is associated with physiological changes, including declines in vision, hearing, motor skills, and cognitive abilities, which can complicate interactions with digital interfaces designed primarily for younger users \cite{smith2021elderlytech, anderson2019agingtech, barnard2018digitaldivide}. This digital divide not only limits older adults' independence but also exacerbates social isolation, health management challenges, and economic participation.

Globally, the aging population is growing rapidly, with the United Nations projecting that by 2050, one in six people will be over 65 years old. In Bangladesh, this demographic shift is particularly pronounced; by 2025, one in ten citizens will be 60 years or older, rising to one in five by 2050 \cite{kabir2025agingbangladesh}. This transition is driven by improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and living conditions, leading to increased life expectancy. However, Bangladesh's context adds unique challenges, including limited access to technology in rural areas, low digital literacy rates among the elderly, and cultural factors influencing technology adoption \cite{islam2019elderlybangladesh, rahman2022localcontext}. The digital divide in Bangladesh is evident, with older adults often excluded from online services due to infrastructure gaps and socioeconomic disparities \cite{rahman2021digitalinequality}.

Assistive technologies, such as voice assistants, customizable interfaces, and simplified navigation tools, hold immense potential to bridge this gap by enhancing usability and accessibility. Yet, many existing solutions fail to account for the diverse needs of older users, resulting in frustration and abandonment of technology. This study delves into these issues by investigating the experiences of older adults in Bangladesh with digital devices, focusing on barriers related to usability, accessibility, and engagement.

Through a mixed-methods approach, including semi-structured interviews, contextual inquiries, and surveys, this research uncovers key pain points—such as small text sizes, complex UI design, and intrusive advertisements—and proposes design guidelines for more inclusive applications. By prioritizing human-centered design principles, the study aims to empower older adults, enabling them to maintain independence, connect with loved ones, and manage health effectively in a digital era \cite{czaja2019aging, fisk2009designing}. Ultimately, this work contributes to the broader goal of reducing the digital divide and promoting active aging in developing contexts like Bangladesh.

The research is guided by three questions (RQs):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What primary challenges faced by older adults can be alleviated through mobile app technology?
    \item How do older adults interact with current technologies and what are their preferences?
    \item What features most effectively increase usability of tech products for older adults?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
The literature on assistive technology for older adults is extensive, spanning technology adoption, accessibility barriers, design principles, and human-centered approaches. This section synthesizes key findings, highlighting gaps addressed by the current study.

\subsection{Technology Adoption Among Older Adults}
Research indicates that while digital adoption among older adults is rising, barriers persist due to perceived complexity and lack of relevance \cite{morris2019techbarriers, peacock2020elderlyusage, anderson2020aging}. Models like the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) emphasize perceived usefulness and ease of use as predictors of adoption \cite{davis1989tam, venkatesh2003vtaut}. For instance, social influence and training access significantly affect older users' willingness to engage with technology \cite{rodriguez2018oldertech, ma2016acceptance, lee2017adoption}. Recent studies in developing contexts, such as Bangladesh, underscore cultural and economic factors, with older adults often relying on family for tech support \cite{islam2019elderlybangladesh}.

Emerging research explores AI-driven technologies' role in adoption. A 2025 study on AI-led health technologies found that older adults accept such tools when they address privacy concerns and provide tangible benefits, though challenges like trust and familiarity remain \cite{lee2025aiolderadults}. Similarly, digital assistive technologies (DigAT) are shown to support independent living, but adoption lags due to usability issues \cite{jones2025digat}.

\subsection{Accessibility and Usability Barriers}
Visual impairments, dexterity limitations, and cognitive decline are primary barriers \cite{johnson2022accessibility, kurniawan2008older, arch2008webaccess}. Design flaws, including small icons, low contrast, and ambiguous feedback, exacerbate these issues \cite{tanaka2020mobileux, hanson2010age, dickinson2007accessibility}. Assistive tools like screen readers are beneficial but often complex, leading to underutilization \cite{frank2018assistiveuse, patterson2021voicebarriers}.

Recent systematic reviews highlight mobile app usability for older adults, identifying barriers like cluttered interfaces and recommending strategies such as adaptive layouts \cite{wang2025mobileappdesign}. Studies on digital health platforms during the COVID-19 era reveal older adults' coping strategies, including hybrid tech use, but emphasize persistent accessibility gaps \cite{smith2024digitalhealth}.

In Bangladesh, the digital divide amplifies these barriers, with low internet penetration and literacy rates hindering access \cite{rahman2021digitalinequality}. Research on e-health acceptance shows qualitative factors like trust and integrity influencing adoption \cite{ahmed2022ehealth}.

\subsection{Assistive Technology and Design Principles}
Voice assistants, large-font modes, and gesture controls enhance usability \cite{smith2019voiceui, zhao2020voiceassist, kalantari2021assistive}. Universal design advocates flexibility and personalization \cite{bennett2020inclusive, chang2023smartaging, mace1997universal}. Simplicity, feedback consistency, and customization are key \cite{norman2016accessible, fisk2009designing, czaja2019aging}.

Innovative applications include smart televisions for social connectivity, reducing isolation among older adults \cite{kim2025smarttv}. Voice assistant adaptations for seniors focus on learning patterns and integration \cite{lopez2025voiceassist}. A 2025 review categorizes 37 assistive technologies, stressing design considerations like affordability and ease \cite{patel2025assistivetech}.

\subsection{Human-Centered and Contextual Design}
Human-Centered Design (HCD) emphasizes user involvement through participatory methods to understand contexts and limitations \cite{norman2013design, ideo2015hcd, buxton2007sketching}. Contextual inquiries reveal real-world pain points not captured in surveys \cite{brown2022contextual, holtzblatt2014contextual, beyer1997contextual}.

Qualitative studies on older adults' tech experiences use thematic analysis to identify themes like discontinuation due to frustration \cite{johnson2023discontinuation}. HCI research critiques narrow definitions of "older adults," advocating inclusive sampling \cite{turner2018hcichallenges}.

\subsection{Gaps in the Literature}
While progress exists, diversity within elderly populations—cultural, educational, economic—is often overlooked \cite{nguyen2021culturetech, lee2018cultural, hill2011cultural}. Systems are typically reactive; this study proposes proactive designs. By integrating Bangladeshi perspectives, it addresses local gaps \cite{rahman2022localcontext}.

\section{Methodology}
This research employs a mixed-methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of older adults' interactions with technology. The integration allows for triangulation, enhancing the validity of findings. Figure \ref{fig:methodology} illustrates the methodology workflow.

\subsection{Participants}
Fourteen participants aged 50–74 were purposively sampled from Dhaka and Meherpur communities, ensuring diversity in gender (8 males, 6 females), education (secondary to university), and occupations (housewives, teachers, business owners, service holders). All had device experience, primarily smartphones.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations and Consent}
All participants provided their informed consent before participation, in accordance with ethical guidelines for human subjects research. Verbal Consent was obtained in Bengali to ensure that the study's purpose, procedures, risks, and participants' rights to withdraw at any time without consequences were explained. Participants were assured of anonymity and data confidentiality, with personal information stored securely and used only for research purposes.

\subsection{Data Collection}

We faced lots of challenges in finding older adults to collect data. Here, we mainly used the purposive sampling method for participant recruitment.

\textbf{Interviews:} Semi-structured interviews (20-30 minutes) explored usage, frustrations, and preferences \cite{creswell2014qualitative, patton2015qualitative}. Transcripts from key participants provided in-depth insights.

\textbf{Contextual Enquiries:} Observations of daily tasks noted behaviors and strategies \cite{beyer1997contextual, holtzblatt2014contextual}.

\textbf{Surveys:} A 16-question form collected demographics and preferences \cite{fowler2013survey, dillman2014internet}.

All related questionnaires can be found in the Questionnaires section A.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysis}
Qualitative data underwent thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke's six-phase framework: (1) familiarization with data, (2) initial coding, (3) theme searching, (4) theme reviewing, (5) theme defining/naming, and (6) report production \cite{braun2006thematic}. This iterative process identified patterns like usability frustration and preference for voice features, validated across sources.

Quantitative survey data used descriptive statistics. Observational notes complemented themes, ensuring robustness.

\section{Findings}
The analysis revealed consistent themes across surveys, interviews, and observations. Participants primarily used smartphones for communication (e.g., calls, Messenger) and entertainment (e.g., YouTube), but faced barriers related to interface complexity and physical limitations. Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4, and Fig 5 are some examples of contextual enquiries.

\subsection{Demographic and Usage Overview}
Table \ref{tab:demographics} summarizes key survey demographics and device usage patterns.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Summary of Participant Demographics and Device Usage}
\label{tab:demographics}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\toprule
Characteristic & Frequency (\%) \\
\midrule
Age: 50-54 & 3 (21.4\%) \\
Age: 55-64 & 9 (64.3\%) \\
Age: 65-74 & 2 (14.3\%) \\
Gender: Male & 8 (57.1\%) \\
Gender: Female & 6 (42.9\%) \\
Education: Secondary/College & 3 (21.4\%) \\
Education: University & 11 (78.6\%) \\

Confidence: Somewhat confident & 6 (42.9\%) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Most participants (85.7\%) used devices several times a day, mainly for communication and entertainment. Confidence levels varied, with 42.9\% feeling somewhat confident and 28.6\% feeling very confident.

\subsection{Usability Challenges}
Participants reported several usability issues:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Small touch targets and icons caused frequent misclicks, as noted in surveys (e.g., "Can't remove advertisement" from a 65-74 year-old female in a rural area) \cite{tanaka2020mobileux, hanson2010age}.
 Also, we found it in a contextual interview, e.g., "Yes, if these are large, it's easier for me to see well because my eyesight is weaker. The small ones are hard to see because if one's eyesight is a bit weak, bigger is better." (from a 55-64 year-old female in a rural area) 
    \item Network problems and device lagging were common, with one participant stating, "Network problem" in the interview (from a 65-74 year-old female in a rural area).
    \item Complex UIs and advertisements interrupted tasks, e.g., "An advertisement comes up... I learned to close it" (from a 65-74 year-old female in a rural area).
    \item Shorts video does not properly complete, making it frustrating. e.g., "One thing, yes, when watching, it is just small, they say "short," it's not that big. " (from a 65-74 year-old female in a rural area).
    \item Sensitive info sometimes goes to the story! as noted in a contextual enquiry (from a 65-74 year-old female in a rural area).
    \item Users rely on relatives for troubleshooting, as noted in the interview/contextual enquiry for most of the users.
\end{itemize}
 
From interviews, a 65-74 year-old male in a rural area highlighted avoiding complex features: "I don't go into complicated fields... I stick to what is easy."

\subsection{Accessibility and Preferences}
Participants preferred features that addressed physical limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Larger text and buttons were favored, e.g., "If it's small, it is difficult to see... Larger is better" (from a 65-74 year-old male in a rural area and from a 65-74 year-old female in a rural area) \cite{frank2018assistiveuse, zhao2020voiceassist}. For color, there is no preference.
    \item Voice assistance and shortcut gestures improved task efficiency, with surveys indicating interest in "Voice based apps" and "Talking is good" from interviews \cite{smith2019voiceui, kalantari2021assistive}.
    \item Simple layouts improve navigation to avoid confusion. \cite{bennett2020inclusive}.
    \item Both Voice and Picture based applications are preferable.
    \item Learning tool like how to send photo/file to other, suggest islamic content playlist etc. One user suggested if possible offline application as internet is still not cheap or available sometimes.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Behavioral Observations}
From contextual enquiries and interviews:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users developed coping mechanisms, such as relying on family for help (71.4\% learned from family/friends) or memorizing icons \cite{brown2022contextual}.
    \item Many relied on relatives for troubleshooting \cite{rodriguez2018oldertech}.
    \item Repetition improved confidence but not efficiency, e.g., "These have become easy for me" (from a 65-74 year-old male in a rural area) \cite{lee2021gerontech}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Implications}
The findings suggest four major design guidelines:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prioritize clarity through minimal layouts and large, simple buttons/icons \cite{norman2016accessible}.
    \item Enable easy customization of text size, contrast, and brightness \cite{chang2023smartaging}.
    \item Offer voice and gesture-based alternatives to typing \cite{zhao2020voiceassist}.
    \item Maintain consistency between app updates and provide offline capabilities where possible \cite{peacock2020elderlyusage}.
    \item Avoid too much advertising.
    \item Add a sensitive information check before upload, or give a proper alert to the user.
    \item Provide the onboarding content for how to use this application.
    \item Provide the common troubleshooting content or make a helpdesk.

\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, integrate proactive tutorials and family-sharing features to support learning.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This study provides foundational insights for developing assistive technologies tailored to older adults in Bangladesh, incorporating diverse data from surveys and interviews. By addressing usability pain points like small interfaces and complex navigation, the proposed guidelines promote digital inclusion. Future work will prototype and evaluate an adaptive mobile interface based on these findings, potentially incorporating AI-driven voice assistance and personalized recommendations \cite{czaja2019aging, fisk2009designing].
